I was building an application for my friend's start up who had the following requirements:

1. Send perodic emails to its clients.
2. Periodicity of each client may be different. For example: ClientA may need an email every other day while ClientB may require a notificaion every week.
3. Ability to attach any file (.doc, .xls, .csv, .jpeg etc).
4. Email-subject/body/attachements sent to each client will be distinct/different/customized.
5. Build an application that can be used someday with a UI.

I have tried to satisfy all above requirements. 
The design has been intentionally made as configurable as possible.

Framework used: Dropwizard.
